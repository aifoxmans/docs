**Q1: What is ePay?**

ePay is a stablecoin payment platform. ePay has obtained transaction authorizations from Singapore's COBO and several banks in the United States and Singapore, allowing merchants to accept payments from global customers using stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) through ePay's checkout system. It combines the speed and security of blockchain technology with the stability of traditional fiat currencies to offer fast, low-cost transaction services. Core features include receiving payments via QR code addresses, settling digital assets to your designated address, and converting them into currencies like USD, EUR, JPY, AUD, HKD, and SGD through Over-The-Counter (OTC) trading.

**Q2: What are the advantages of paying with stablecoins?**

The main advantages include:

- **Unlimited Transactions**: Supports large-value transactions without limits.
- **Global Accessibility**: Customers can easily complete payments from anywhere in the world, without the cross-border restrictions of traditional banks.
- **Low Transaction Costs**: Transaction fees are typically lower compared to traditional credit cards or cross-border remittances.
- **Fast Transaction Speed**: Blockchain-based payments are usually confirmed within minutes, far faster than traditional bank transfers that can take several days.
- **Transparency and Security**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, making them public, transparent, and immutable, which enhances security.
- **Avoids Exchange Rate Volatility**: Stablecoins are pegged 1:1 to fiat currencies like the US dollar, effectively mitigating the price fluctuation risks associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

**Q3: Which stablecoins does the platform support?**

We currently support major stablecoins in the market, such as USDT (Tether) and USDC (USD Coin). We support these tokens on various blockchain networks, including TRC20 (Tron), ERC20 (Ethereum), and BEP20 (BNB Smart Chain), to provide more flexible and cost-effective payment options.

**Q4: How can merchants receive payments through the platform?**

(1) **Manual Order Process (suitable for offline or single orders)**. Simply enter the payment amount in your backend system, and it will automatically generate an exclusive QR code containing the payment amount, stablecoin type, and receiving address. The customer can complete the payment by scanning this QR code with their digital wallet. It's simple, direct, and requires no technical development.

(2) **Checkout API Process (suitable for websites or apps)**. Integrate ePay's API into your website or application. When a customer checks out on your platform, the system will automatically trigger the payment. After a successful payment, ePay will automatically notify your system to confirm the order. The entire process is automated and requires no manual intervention.

**Q5: Do customers need to have a crypto wallet to pay?**

Yes. Customers need to use a digital wallet that supports the corresponding stablecoin and blockchain network (e.g., Tron, Ethereum), such as Trust Wallet or MetaMask, or an exchange wallet like Coinbase Wallet or Binance Wallet, to scan the QR code and authorize the transaction.

**Q6: How can I confirm if a payment is successful?**

Once the customer completes the payment, the blockchain network will begin processing the transaction. After the transaction is confirmed, the order status in your merchant backend will be immediately updated to "Completed." You can also check the detailed status of the transaction using a blockchain explorer.

**Q7: Where are the stablecoins I receive stored?**

Stablecoins paid by customers are uniformly deposited into your fully-managed funds account on the platform. We employ bank-level security measures to ensure the absolute safety of your funds. You can view your balance and initiate settlements from the backend at any time.

**Q8: Can I withdraw the stablecoins I receive to my own wallet or exchange?**

Of course. You can initiate a settlement request in the merchant backend at any time to withdraw the stablecoin balance from your platform wallet address to any external wallet address you specify, such as your personal hardware wallet or a deposit address on an exchange like Binance or Coinbase.

**Q9: What is an OTC withdrawal?**

OTC (Over-The-Counter) withdrawal is the process of converting your stablecoins into a fiat currency (such as USD, EUR, JPY, AUD, HKD, or SGD) and depositing it into your designated bank account. We partner with compliant OTC service providers and banks to offer you a secure and convenient channel for fiat currency exchange. It supports withdrawals to personal accounts and provides proof of funds.

**Q10: How can I convert my stablecoins to US dollars?**

You can initiate an OTC withdrawal settlement in the ePay merchant portal. The system will transfer the stablecoins to a designated address of our partner OTC provider. Once the provider receives the funds and verifies them, they will transfer the corresponding amount of "USD/EUR/JPY/AUD/HKD/SGD" to your specified global bank account (personal accounts are supported).

**Q11: Is OTC withdrawal secure? How long does it take to arrive?**

We only partner with strictly vetted and licensed OTC service providers and banks to ensure the security of your funds. The entire process is regulated by Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws. Typically, after the OTC provider receives your stablecoins, the USD remittance will arrive in your bank account within 1-3 business days, depending on the bank's processing speed.

**Q12: Is identity verification required to register and use the platform?**

Yes. To comply with global Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CFT) regulations, all merchants must complete corporate identity verification (KYB - Know Your Business) or personal identity verification (KYC - Know Your Customer) before conducting settlements or OTC withdrawals. This helps ensure the security of funds for all users on the platform.

**Q13: What is the platform's fee structure?**

- **Receiving Payments**: A fixed percentage service fee is charged for each successful payment and is automatically deducted from the incoming amount.
- **Settlement Withdrawal**: For single withdrawals exceeding a certain threshold, we waive the network fee (Gas Fee), and there is no platform service fee. For amounts below this threshold, you will need to cover the network fee.
- **OTC Withdrawal**: The exchange rate is 1:1 (no spread). For single withdrawals exceeding a certain threshold, the network fee is waived, and you only need to cover the bank's wire transfer fee.
