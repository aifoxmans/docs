During product configuration, please be sure to follow these security recommendations to maximize the protection of your team's digital assets and operational security. A comprehensive security configuration is the first line of defense for asset protection.

If you would like a professional security team to conduct a full review of your configuration, please contact our customer support for assistance.

## Risk Control Overview

EPay Portal provides a multi-layered, fine-grained risk control mechanism designed to address various security challenges faced in the storage, management, and transfer of digital assets, helping teams build a robust risk control system.

## User Roles and Permissions Management

User roles consist of a series of predefined permission rules that can be used to assign operational permissions to team members with precision.

- It is recommended to configure **at least 2 administrators** for the team to achieve cross-validation of operations and to serve as backups for each other.
- Other roles (such as Operator, Viewer, etc.) should be assigned properly according to actual business needs, following the principle of least privilege.
- Try to avoid assigning multiple roles to the same member to reduce the risk of excessive permission concentration.

## Transaction Risk Control Strategy

You can flexibly set up off-chain and on-chain transaction risk control rules and manage each transaction automatically through an approval process.

- **On-chain Transaction Risk Control**: Managed by blockchain smart contracts and related to various business processes.
- **Off-chain Transaction Risk Control**: Managed by the EPay Portal backend system, providing crucial security for merchant funds.

Transaction risk control is the core security barrier for your team. Please configure it strictly, especially for large-amount withdrawal scenarios. Pay special attention to the following high-risk situations:

- No risk control rules are set.
- There are transaction blind spots not covered by risk control.
- All transactions are set to be automatically approved.
- The same role has both withdrawal and approval permissions.

<Info>
  Please focus on the settlement strategy in off-chain transaction risk control to avoid the high-risk configurations mentioned above.

## Business Operation Risk Control

Business risk control determines the approval processes and rules required for key operations. The following are high-risk operations in EPay Portal, and it is strongly recommended to set them to require **approval from at least 2 administrators**:

- Inviting new members
- Changing a member's user role
- Editing business risk control rules themselves
- Managing transaction risk control strategies
- Managing addresses in the address book
- Managing API Keys
- Editing custom user roles
- Managing wallets and gas stations

## Administrator Identity Authentication

To significantly enhance account security and reduce the risk of account theft, **it is strongly recommended that all administrator accounts enable two-factor authentication (2FA) or stronger authentication methods**.

Recommended combinations are as follows:

- Funding Password + Google Authenticator (GA)
- Funding Password + Secure Email Verification
- Google Authenticator (GA) + Secure Email Verification

## API Key Security Settings

Administrators and Operators can register API Keys in the developer console and assign them specific roles, permissions, and IP access policies.

- **When using a long-term API Key**, be sure to set a strict `IP whitelist` and configure a `Callback URL`.
- Properly configure `wallet scope` permissions, following the principle of minimization. **`Try to avoid granting permissions to any type of wallet`**.
